Participants will swim 1.2 miles (1.9 km) in the waters of Agua Dulce Beach in the Pacific Ocean. They will then cycle 56 miles (90 km) on a flat, fast route along the Playas Costa Verde circuit road. There, participants must complete three 30-km laps on wide roads that will be open exclusively to bicycles. The running leg consists of a 13.1-mile (21 km) course in two out-and-back loops along the Playas circuit boardwalk. Overlooking Lima's beautiful beaches, the course is mostly flat and fast and ends at Agua Dulce Beach, Chorrillos, Lima, Peru, with a spectacular view of the Lima skyline.
