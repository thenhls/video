For the fourth time in five seasons, the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers will collide in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, opening their First Round series at Amalie Arena on Tuesday, April 22. But unlike previous meetings in 2021 and 2022‚Äîwhen Tampa entered as the reigning champion‚Äîit's now Florida that carries the crown.

And if history is any guide, the winner of this clash often goes the distance: each time these two have met in the postseason, one of them has skated all the way to the Final.

This series features two heavyweights from the stacked Atlantic Division, meaning one legitimate Cup contender is guaranteed an early exit. The regular season meetings didn‚Äôt offer much separation either, with the two teams splitting their four-game set.

Interestingly, the road side came out on top in the first two December matchups‚ÄîFlorida snatching a 4-2 win in Tampa before the Bolts roared back with a 4-0 shutout in Sunrise just 24 hours later. The Panthers edged a 2-1 victory at home in early March, but Tampa made a statement with a commanding 5-1 win in their most recent meeting on April 15.
