There will be numerous roads closed and changes to public transport for much of Sunday as the run progresses through Belfast.

Organisers say 6,500 full marathon runners have signed up, as well as 2,750 relay teams (which have between two and five people in them), with a further 1200 walkers.

Chairman John Allen said the marathon team was "delighted to welcome over 22,000 participants of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds".

Some are running it professionally, while others are running or walking for charity.
