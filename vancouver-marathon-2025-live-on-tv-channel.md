Non-runners will line the routes to cheer on those who are racing, and organizers are also hosting block parties on race day on Cambie Street, in Kitsilano, at English Bay, in Coal Harbour and at multiple locations downtown.

There’s also a free health, sports and lifestyle expo at the Vancouver Convention Centre on Friday and Saturday. Lots more information can be found on the marathon website.
