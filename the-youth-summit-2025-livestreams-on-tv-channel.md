As part of a growing list of end-of-season events, The Youth Summit will brings competitors back to the Tampa Convention Center in Tampa, Florida, on April 24-25, and all of the excitement will be broadcast live on Varsity TV.

This event is geared toward youth teams that previously would’ve been able to compete against the best of the best at The Summit – that was until 2020, when the youth divisions were eliminated. 

Two years later, the creation of the Youth Summit was announced, with the first event taking place in Tampa in April 2023.

Throughout each season now, Varsity All Star teams in eligible divisions can earn bids to the Youth Summit, where younger athletes get the chance to shine against top-caliber talent in a similar age range. 

Along with a prestigious event and top-tier venue, the athletes and their supporters get to spend some time together in the Florida sunshine, which is a memorable prize in itself.

The Tampa area includes incredible beach experiences, outdoor activities, wildlife, water sports, amusement parks, sporting events, museums, galleries and countless events. It’s the perfect mix of beach life and city living. 

Take a look at the schedule for The Youth Summit 2025. Competition will take place in the West Hall, Central Hall and East Hall at the 600,000-square foot Tampa Convention Center.
