Sunday’s race marks the 46th anniversary, with multiple runs throughout Sunday including a marathon, relay, half-marathon, 5K run and walk and 10K run. The city-wide race is expected to draw in people from around the country. 

Sam D’Arc, a race committee member, said there’s plenty to do for spectators or people wanting to take in the excitement.

“There are a lot of different activities, there are a lot of vendors from all over Western Michigan, featuring health and wellness activities and that sort of thing,” D’Arc said. “So there’s food, there’s beverage. We are excited to invite the entire Kalamazoo community into this space.”

There are an estimated 4,000 runners and 1,000 volunteers expected for Sunday. There are also 34 runners from around the country, and organizers are aiming to have all 50 states represented in the future.
