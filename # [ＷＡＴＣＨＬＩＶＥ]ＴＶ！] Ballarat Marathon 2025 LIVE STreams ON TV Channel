There are already more than 9000 entries across all events registered so far â€“ almost double the total from the inaugural event in 2024.

And of the total entries to date, about 80 percent are visitors to Ballarat, showcasing the city to thousands of people and resulting in accommodation being at capacity.  

An expected injection of at least $3.1 million into the Ballarat economy is projected due to the event.

With almost 3000 entrants in the 42.2km full marathon alone, the event has already grown to be the fourth biggest marathon race in Australia, behind Sydney, Gold Coast and Melbourne. The half marathon event is capped at 3500 entries and has been sold out for weeks.

Entertainment offerings will be located throughout the course, with local businesses joining in to build the hype and monumental fundraising efforts under way, the event has once again captured the imagination of the entire city.
