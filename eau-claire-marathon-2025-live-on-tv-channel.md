Eau Claire Marathon race director Emi Uelmen said, in total, about 5,100 people are signed up to participate, making this year the largest marathon weekend yet.

"Welcome people in," Uelmen said. "We have 46 states people are coming from, a couple from Canada, a couple from the Netherlands, so it's really going to be a cool way to showcase Eau Claire, Wisconsin."

New this year is the Eau Claire Marathon Expo Saturday at the Sonnentag Center. The expo showcases local businesses and other community groups for people visiting Eau Claire for the weekend.

Uelmen said in 2024, marathon weekend brought in about $5.4 million in economic impact to the city.

"We want every hotel full, we want every business in downtown booked for dinner," Uelmen said. "And then with something like the expo, you can even learn a little bit more."

There will be road closures for race weekend, mostly Sunday morning through early afternoon, including much of downtown and the Lake Street and Madison Street bridges.
