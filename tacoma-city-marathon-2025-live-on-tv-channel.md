Run 3 races in 2 days! Kick off Saturday morning with the 5K or 10K (8:00 am start) and afterwards, run the Ghost of Tacoma Marathon or Half Marathon (9:00 am start). Then complete the weekend with the Tacoma City Marathon or Half Marathon on Sunday.

Sunday‚Äôs Marathon and Half Marathon are point-to-point courses running across the iconic Narrows Bridge and finishing at Tacoma‚Äôs beautiful Dune Peninsula Park, the Northwest‚Äôs premier waterfront neighborhood. This picturesque entertainment and recreation hub is situated along Commencement Bay with panoramic views of the Puget Sound, the Olympic and Cascade Mountain ranges.

Runners will enjoy a scenic, USATF-Certified and Boston Qualifying course that passes through Point Defiance Park, with over 700 acres of beautiful gardens and old growth forests. After exiting Pt. Defiance, the Marathon and Half Marathon runners will cross over the Wilson Way Bridge with a sweet half mile downhill to the Puget Sound and Dune Peninsula Park where the Half Marathon will finish. The Marathon will continue down the flat and fast waterfront with views of Mt. Rainier and the Puget Sound. The Marathon turnaround is along the Thea Foss Waterway Esplanade and the beautiful Museum of Glass.
