Victory is for the athletes that go hard, and crash harder. The ones whose faith is bigger than their fears, and ambition is greater than their setbacks. Victory is for the bunny-hop cartwheels, the full-in-full-out, the strikes, the stretchesm the namaste. We are there for the high-fives, the friendships, and camaraderie, and the getting up one more time than you fall. There to witness your wins, and protecting you for those try-again-tomorrows. From the moment the doors open to the lights go out, Victory is on your side!
