Race organizers recommend planning to be downtown by 5:15 a.m. Sunday. Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum CEO Kari Watkins said the changes to the weekend's schedule were necessary to keep runners safe.

"We had looked forward to welcoming the 5k, the kids, and the seniors to the start line and the finish line," Watkins said. "If you are registered for the 5k you will receive and email this afternoon."

Watkins said the decision did not come easy, as they consulted with their team, which included communicating with over 300 law enforcement officials, thousands of volunteers, and even a team of meteorologists.

The slate of events for the Sunday OKC Memorial Marathon will still take place according to the announcement, and the addition of the 5k at 7:30 a.m. will be the only addition to tomorrow's schedule.
