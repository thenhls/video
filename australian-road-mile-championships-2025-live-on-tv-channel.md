Some of the best middle distance runners in the nation will be taking to the streets of Ballarat in April after the Running Warehouse Ballarat Marathon was named host of the inaugural Australian Road Mile Championships.

The races will cap off the Ballarat Marathon’s opening day program, which also features elite races over 5km along with mass-participation races over both one mile and 5km.

Athletics Australia Board Member and Ballarat Marathon Race Director, Steve Moneghetti:

“We are delighted to be hosting the first Australian Road Mile Championships. It is our aim to build a world-class event that elevates the profile of road running over a range of distances and also celebrates my beautiful home town of Ballarat. Hosting the Championships is a big step along this journey.

“Our mile races were a brilliant part of the inaugural Ballarat Marathon program earlier this year, and this elevates the races to another level. We can’t wait to see some of our best runners blaze their way through the streets in April.”
