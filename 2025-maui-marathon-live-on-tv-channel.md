We are pleased to announce that the Maui Marathon, presented by The Westin Maui Resort & Spa, will return to Ka’anapali in 2025! All events will start and finish in Ka’anapali from the exact location as in the past, in front of the Outrigger Ka’anapali Beach Resort. The new Full Marathon, Half Marathon and 10K course will be an out-and-back on the Honoapiilani Hwy (Route 30). The 5K will remain the same course with no changes from previous years. For full marathon runners, this will be a flatter and faster course with ocean views along much of the course. On behalf of the Maui Marathon committee members, we are incredibly pleased to have the Maui Marathon back in Ka’anapali. We hope you will join us for the exciting return on Sunday, April 27, 2025!
